# vars

This directory contains all vars. These files are included from the cer.adoc from canned-content, and enable us to put in variables to use throughout the document.

## document-vars.adoc
This contains document information, such as customer name, project name etc. 

## redhat-vars.adoc
This contains short names for products. Now, you can for instance write {rhel} in the CER which will render to the full product name. 

## render-vars.adoc
This describes how the file is created. Might be put into the styles/pdf later
