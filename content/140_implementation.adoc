Purpose
-------
In the "Base" directory, this section is a placeholder which is to be
overwritten by implementation details specific to the product or products being
delivered.

If "TODO" appears in your document after the init script has been run, then
your product directory is missing a corresponding "implementation.adoc" which
should be created to provide a basic implementation framework for that product.
