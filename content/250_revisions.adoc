Purpose
-------
At a minimum, the initial creation date should be recorded and each time the
document is modified just prior to being shared with a customer.

Document versions are analogous to publications and should only be used to
describe significant progress or updates and not minor corrections or
alterations. For example, it would not be appropriate to publish a new version
each time the daily journal is updated.

Try to keep within the range of three and ten revisions. However, each
engagement has different potential needs in terms of documentation, so good
judgment should be used if a greater number of revisions are required.

For simplicity, it is recommended that each version be represented by an
integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc...) with the initial creation being version '0'.

Changes listed for each version should include completion of major sections,
additions and customer requested updates.
