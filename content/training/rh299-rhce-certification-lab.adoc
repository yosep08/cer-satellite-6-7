*Course description*

Prepare for the Red Hat Certified Engineer exam (EX300)

The RHCE(R) Certification lab (RH299) is a facilitated lab environment for students to work at their own pace through a hands-on review prior to taking the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) exam (EX300).

Students attending this lab should have already completed their classroom training and simply be preparing to take or retake the exam. The delivery is focused primarily on lab time.
