= Microsoft Windows Automation with Red Hat Ansible (DO417)



*Course description*

Learn how to automate administration on Windows Server to enable your DevOps workflow

Microsoft Windows Automation with Red Hat Ansible (DO417) is designed for Windows Server professionals without previous Ansible(R) experience. You will use Ansible to write automation playbooks for Microsoft Windows systems to perform common system administration tasks reproducibly at scale. You will also learn to use Red Hat(R) Ansible Tower to securely manage and run your Ansible playbooks from a central web-based user interface.

This course is based on Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8, Red Hat Ansible Tower 3.5, and Windows Server 2016 and 2019.
