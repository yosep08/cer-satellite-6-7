= Red Hat Security: Securing Containers and OpenShift (DO425)



*Course description*
Learn to mitigate and manage threats to OpenShift container-based infrastructure
Red Hat Security: Securing Containers and OpenShift (DO425) is designed to help infrastructure administrators and security professionals learn to identity and mitigate threats to OpenShift container-based infrastructure. The curriculum also covers how to implement and manage secure architecture, policies, and procedures for modern containerized applications and software-defined networking.
This course is based on Red Hat(R)Enterprise Linux(R) 7.5, Red Hat(R) OpenShift(R) Container Platform 3.11, and Red Hat(R) Identity Manager 7.5.


You will learn about using secure and trusted container images, registries, and source code; managing network and storage isolation; implementing application single sign-on; and configuring appropriate security constraints and service role–based access control. You will also find out how existing core Linux technologies—such as namespaces, cgroups, seccomp, capabilities, and SELinux—provide a robust and mature host environment with strongly secure containers.
