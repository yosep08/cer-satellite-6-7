How is this course different from any other agile training?

Who should attend?

This course is designed for business product owners, developers, and engineers eager to deliver continuous value to customers through an enhanced understanding of changing customer needs and the ability to reduce the time needed to get new ideas to market.

In addition, the course mimics a real-world delivery team, making this offering a unique fit for cross-functional teams interested in learning how collaboration can breed innovation. Armed with shared experiences and best practices, the team can apply what it has learned to benefit the businessâ€™s culture and bottom line in the pursuit of new projects and improved processes.
