Purpose
-------
This section is intended to record deliberate collaboration between Red Hat and
the customer. Knowledge transfer is a two-way activity so this includes both
activities where Red Hat is gathering information from the customer and where
information is being communicated to the customer.  As this section may be used
to demonstrate completion of certain SOW tasks it is important to record
attendance whenever possible.

Activities which should be captured
- Discovery workshops
- Meetings to reach consensus on in-flight decisions
- Documentation review
- Progress demonstrations
- Executive briefings
- Ad-hoc training or review for non-Participants
