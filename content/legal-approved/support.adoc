== Red Hat Support severity level definitions
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/severity/[https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/severity/]

Opening a support case online can make it easier to share technical data, error messages, and system information with your Red Hat Support representative. Following the online submission with a phone call can reduce response time as well as potential errors in the capture of information.

Red Hat recommends that you follow any Severity 1 and 2 online support case submissions with a phone call to your local support center.

Red Hat Global Support Services uses the following definitions to classify issues:

=== Severity 1 (urgent)
A problem that severely impacts your use of the software in a production environment (such as loss of production data or in which your production systems are not functioning). The situation halts your business operations and no procedural workaround exists.

=== Severity 2 (high)
A problem where the software is functioning but your use in a production environment is severely reduced. The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business operations and no procedural workaround exists.

=== Severity 3 (medium)
A problem that involves partial, non-critical loss of use of the software in a production environment or development environment. For production environments, there is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround. For development environments, where the situation is causing your project to no longer continue or migrate into production.

=== Severity 4 (low)
A general usage question, reporting of a documentation error, or recommendation for a future product enhancement or modification. For production environments, there is low-to-no impact on your business or the performance or functionality of your system. For development environments, there is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround.

== Tips to create a good support case

. Fill out the account number, your name, it is recommended to be individual instead global account.
. Select the product that it is affected.
. Version of the product.
. Problem statement should be precise to see if they are any KCS that help you on the resolution. Please read the KCS suggested before open a case. Remember use the name of the component that you are having issue – Ceph …. , Nova …. Keywords are very important.
. Explain your issue with the maximum details and add the commands that you are using with outputs.
. Problem statement should be descriptive like: [Component][Region] Issue description. +
Examples would be: +
_[Nova][NL Region] Nova fails on one compute_ +
_[Ceph][Singapore Region] Ceph without OSD_
. Explain your issue with the maximum details and add the commands that you are using with outputs.
